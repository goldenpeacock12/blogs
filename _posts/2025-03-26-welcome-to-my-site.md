I'm **Baby John**, a Computer Science graduate with a specialization in Cybersecurity. My experience spans across OSINT, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), and Malware Analysis, where I’ve developed a strong foundation in identifying and understanding digital threats. I’m also well-versed in Python, which I often use to automate tasks, build tools, and analyze data. With a passion for uncovering hidden patterns and staying ahead of evolving cyber threats, I’m always eager to learn, adapt, and contribute to the security landscape.
